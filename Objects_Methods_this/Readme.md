## Dif. Object functions
- Object.keys( ) 
- Object.values( )
- Object.assign( )
- Object.hasOwnProperty( )

### Object.assign( ) :


> which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It invokes getters and setters since it uses both [[Get]] on the source and [[Set]] on the target. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. Object.assign() does not throw on null or undefined source values.

    Applications: 
 
        •	Object.assign() is used for cloning an object.
        •	Object.assign() is used to merge object with same properties.


### The hasOwnProperty( )
     It returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).
